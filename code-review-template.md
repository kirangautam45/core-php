### AI Usage Assessment

- [ ] Student demonstrates genuine understanding
- [ ] Code complexity matches skill level
- [ ] Can modify and debug their own code
- [ ] Consistent with previous work

### Confidence Level
- [ ] High - Student clearly wrote this themselves
- [ ] Medium - Some concerns but acceptable
- [ ] Low - Strong indicators of AI assistance without understanding

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] None needed
- [ ] Require resubmission with in-class coding
- [ ] Schedule additional review
- [ ] Discuss academic integrity

## Quick Reference: Common AI Red Flags

1. Perfect error handling for edge cases not discussed in class
2. Uses advanced concepts (ternary, null coalescing) inconsistently
3. Over-commented obvious code
4. Cannot make simple changes without looking things up
5. Variable names suddenly very descriptive
6. Code structure dramatically different from in-class examples
